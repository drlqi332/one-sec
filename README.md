# One Sec Pro Deal: Cut Screen Time by 57%, Reclaim Hours Daily, Build Healthier Digital Habits

You know that feeling when you unlock your phone "just to check something quickly," and thirty minutes later you're still scrolling through Instagram or TikTok? Your brain is caught in a loop, your thumb moving on autopilot, and suddenly an hour of your life has vanished into the digital void. That's not laziness or lack of willpower—that's neuroscience working against you.

Social media platforms have figured out how to hijack your dopamine system. Every refresh, every new post, every notification is engineered to keep you hooked. The companies behind these apps employ armies of psychologists and engineers whose job is to make their platforms as addictive as possible. They're very good at what they do.

<img width="2853" height="1522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd823c4-8bc5-4106-819d-2a728000a6c9" />

Here's the thing though: fighting fire with fire doesn't work. Completely blocking apps makes you feel restricted, so you end up disabling the blocker within days. Willpower alone fails because the habit is unconscious—your hand reaches for your phone before your conscious mind even registers what's happening.

That's where one sec takes a different approach. Instead of locking you out completely, it introduces a moment of friction right when you need it most. When you try to open that distracting app, one sec intercepts and asks you to take a breath. Just one second to pause and ask yourself: "Do I really want to open this right now?"

## What Makes One Sec Different From Other Screen Time Apps

Most screen time management tools operate on a punishment model. They block apps entirely, set hard time limits, or guilt-trip you with statistics about your usage. The problem? Your brain quickly learns to bypass these barriers. You disable the app when you "really need" to check something, and before you know it, the blocker stays disabled permanently.

One sec flips this script. Instead of blocking, it delays. Instead of restricting, it creates awareness. The app was developed in collaboration with psychologists from the Max Planck Institute and Heidelberg University, and peer-reviewed research confirms its effectiveness. In a controlled study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that one sec reduced app usage by 57% on average over a six-week period.

Think about that for a moment. Not 5% or 10%—we're talking about cutting your mindless scrolling nearly in half, backed by actual science, not marketing hype.

The secret is in the intervention method. When you attempt to open a configured app—Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, whatever steals your time—one sec appears with a breathing exercise. You're prompted to take a deep breath, count to three, five, or ten seconds (you choose the duration), and then decide whether you still want to proceed. In 36% of cases, users close the app after the intervention without ever opening it. They realize they didn't actually want or need to be there in the first place.

## How One Sec Actually Works: Breaking the Muscle Memory

Your phone addiction isn't really about the phone. It's about habit loops that have been carved into your brain through thousands of repetitions. You feel bored → you unlock your phone → you tap Instagram → dopamine hits → repeat. This sequence becomes so automatic that it bypasses conscious thought entirely.

One sec disrupts this loop at the critical moment—right between "tap the app" and "dopamine reward." By inserting a breathing exercise, it forces your prefrontal cortex (the thinking part of your brain) to come online and evaluate whether this is what you actually want to be doing right now.

The app offers multiple intervention types that you can customize based on what works for you. There's the classic deep breathing exercise, which uses a visual animation to guide you through inhaling and exhaling. There's a mirror intervention that activates your phone's camera so you see your own face looking back at you—surprisingly effective at making you think twice. There's a text input option where you have to type a random phrase before proceeding, adding just enough friction to break the automatic behavior.

For those serious about changing their habits, one sec also offers complete app blocking during specific time periods or "focus sessions." Maybe you need Instagram completely inaccessible during work hours, or you want YouTube off-limits after 10 PM. The blocking feature integrates seamlessly with iOS Focus Modes and Android's Digital Wellbeing tools.

Beyond interventions, one sec tracks your usage patterns without being creepy about it. All your data stays on your device—the company doesn't collect, analyze, or sell your information. You can see how many times you attempted to open apps, how often interventions worked, and how your screen time trends over days and weeks.

## The Science Behind One Sec: More Than Marketing Claims

Most productivity apps throw around terms like "scientifically proven" without any actual science to back them up. One sec is different. The developers partnered with the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Heidelberg University to conduct rigorous, peer-reviewed research on the app's effectiveness.

The study, published in PNAS (one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals), followed users over six weeks. Researchers found that one sec reduced target app usage by 57% on average. But here's what makes the results even more compelling: the effect was sustained over time. Users didn't just cut back for a few days and then revert to old habits—the reduction persisted throughout the entire study period.

Two mechanisms drove this change. First, in 36% of app opening attempts, users closed the app immediately after the intervention without ever proceeding. The breathing exercise gave them just enough pause to realize they didn't actually want to be on that app right then. Second, over six weeks, users attempted to open target apps 37% less frequently than in the first week. The interventions weren't just stopping impulsive openings—they were actually rewiring the automatic habit loop.

Even more impressive: the app has been validated by government health programs in Germany and Denmark for digital wellbeing initiatives. Psychologists, therapists, and psychiatrists around the world recommend it to their patients. It's not just popular—it's actually effective.

One testimonial that stood out mentioned a user whose screen time had ballooned to 19 hours per day. After using one sec, they cut that down by 17 hours. Others describe reclaiming two hours of sleep per week, or finally being able to focus on work without the constant pull of social media.

## Free vs Pro: What You Actually Get With Each Plan

Here's something refreshing: one sec doesn't hide its functionality behind a paywall and then ambush you with limitations. The free version is genuinely useful. You can configure one app with interventions, test whether the approach works for you, and decide if it's worth paying for expanded features.

The free tier includes access to the basic breathing exercise intervention. You choose one app that's stealing your time—maybe it's Instagram, maybe it's TikTok, maybe it's that news app you doomscroll through for hours—and one sec will intervene every time you try to open it. This alone can make a significant difference for many users.

But let's be honest: most people struggle with more than one distraction. That's where one sec pro comes in. Here's what you unlock with the premium subscription:

**Unlimited Apps:** Configure interventions for as many apps and websites as you want. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, news sites—all of them can get the one sec treatment.

**Advanced Interventions:** Beyond the basic breathing exercise, you get access to the mirror mode, text input challenges, phone rotation prompts, structured integration techniques, and more. Different interventions work better for different apps, so having variety helps.

**Website Blocking:** The browser extension brings one sec to your computer, intercepting distracting websites across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers. Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

**Complete Blocking:** Sometimes you need apps locked down entirely, not just delayed. Pro users can set up block sessions or scheduled blocks that prevent configured apps from opening at all during specified times.

**Time Tracking:** See detailed analytics about your app usage patterns, intervention success rates, and progress over time. The data stays private on your device.

**Adult Content Filter:** One sec can intercept attempts to access adult websites with a delay that helps break impulsive behaviors.

**Customizable Schedules:** Set different intervention rules for different times of day. Maybe you want gentle reminders during the day but complete blocks after bedtime.

If you're ready to take control of your digital habits and want to experience these premium features, there's currently a special offer that includes one free month of one sec pro. This gives you full access to test all the advanced interventions, unlimited app blocking, and cross-platform functionality before committing. 👉 [Get one month free of one sec pro here](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) and discover which interventions work best for rewiring your screen time habits.

## Pricing Breakdown: What One Sec Pro Actually Costs

Let's talk money, because subscription fatigue is real and nobody wants another monthly charge that adds up to hundreds of dollars per year. One sec keeps its pricing straightforward and reasonable.

The company offers three payment options for the individual plan:

| Plan Type | Price | Best For | Special Offer |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Annual Subscription** | $19.99/year | Most users seeking long-term habit change |  [Get 1 month free trial with this deal](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) |
| **Monthly Subscription** | $2.99/month | Testing premium features short-term | Available with trial period |
| **Lifetime License** | Varies by region | One-time payment for permanent access | Check current availability |

The annual plan works out to about $1.67 per month—less than a cup of coffee. If you calculate how much time you reclaim (studies show an average of 2+ hours per week), you're essentially paying pennies per hour of your life back.

For teams, schools, or organizations, one sec offers multi-seat licenses starting at 83 cents per user per month when billed annually. If you're managing digital wellness for a group, this becomes incredibly cost-effective.

One detail worth noting: the app works across all your personal devices with a single subscription. Install it on your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, and computer, then sign in with the same account. You're not paying per device—you're paying for the service, period.

Many apps in this category charge $50-100+ per year, or they hide critical features behind expensive tiers. One sec's pricing feels refreshingly honest for what it delivers.

The current promotional offer includes one free month of pro access, giving you a full 30 days to test all premium features. During this time, you can configure unlimited apps, try different intervention styles, and see if the approach fits your lifestyle. 👉 [Start your free month of one sec pro now](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) and experience the full power of scientifically-backed friction before committing to a subscription.

## Real User Experiences: What People Actually Say About One Sec

With over 100,000 five-star reviews across the App Store and Google Play, one sec has built a reputation that goes beyond marketing hype. Let's look at what actual users report after living with the app for weeks or months.

One user named Harold Singh wrote: "I just graduated as a doctor and was burning out. Since getting rid of social media with this app, my focus is coming back. Maybe gave me my life back." That's not hyperbole from someone testing an app for a day—that's a medical professional who found the tool genuinely transformative.

A 16-year-old user named Oscar shared: "I'm 16 and phone addiction is normalized. I decided I didn't want to waste my life away anymore. This app helped me out significantly." The fact that teenagers—the demographic most deeply embedded in phone culture—find it effective speaks volumes about the intervention approach.

Then there's Diva, who reported: "My screen time was over 19 hours a day. One sec cut it down by 17 HOURS. It breaks the muscle memory of unconsciously opening apps. It works." Going from 19 hours to 2 hours of screen time is a life-changing shift that most blocking apps simply can't deliver.

The common thread across reviews is that strict blockers failed for these users. They'd install an app, set up blocks, feel restricted, then disable everything within a week. One sec's intervention model—creating awareness rather than punishment—proved sustainable where hard blocks failed.

Natalie wrote: "This app works so well it is almost annoying. It blocks social media and if I need an extra boost, I use the strict block option. An amazing app." The word "annoying" is actually a compliment here—the friction is working exactly as designed.

Not everyone loves it, of course. Some users find the setup process on iOS fiddly because it requires configuring Shortcuts automations. Others wish there were more intervention types or better customization options. A few mention that determined scrolling can still break through if you're not genuinely committed to change.

But the overwhelming majority report that one sec helped where nothing else did. Users describe reclaiming time for hobbies, improving sleep quality, being more present with family, and feeling less anxious and overwhelmed. Several specifically mention it as "the holy grail for ADHD relief," helping manage the impulsive app-switching that makes focus nearly impossible.

If you're tired of downloading productivity apps that promise miracles but deliver guilt trips and restrictions that you'll disable within a week, one sec offers something different. The science is solid, the approach is respectful, and the results speak for themselves. 👉 [Claim your free month of one sec pro](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) and join over 100,000 users who've successfully rewired their relationship with their devices.

## One Sec Across Platforms: iPhone, Android, Mac, and Browser

Digital distraction isn't limited to your phone. You close Instagram on your iPhone, walk to your computer, and suddenly you're scrolling the same content on the web. One sec recognizes this reality and offers cross-platform coverage so the friction follows you wherever temptation appears.

**iPhone and iPad:** The iOS version integrates deeply with Apple's Shortcuts automation system. You configure which apps should trigger interventions, choose your preferred breathing exercise or friction method, and the app handles the rest. It works with iOS Focus Modes, so you can have different intervention rules for Work, Personal, Sleep, and custom focuses you create.

**Android:** The Android version uses accessibility permissions to detect when you open configured apps and immediately overlay the intervention screen. Setup is generally simpler than iOS since it doesn't require building Shortcuts. The app includes the same core features: breathing exercises, app blocking, usage tracking, and customizable schedules.

**Mac:** One sec offers a native Mac application that works as a background process, intercepting attempts to open distracting native apps like Twitter or Discord. The Mac version syncs your settings across devices if you're signed into the same account.

**Browser Extension:** This is where one sec really shines for knowledge workers and students. The extension is available for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. You add websites to your distraction list—Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, news sites, whatever pulls you away from work—and one sec intervenes when you try to visit them.

The browser extension is completely free, even without a pro subscription. It includes basic interventions and tracking. Pro users get advanced features like scheduled blocking and customizable intervention types.

Here's what makes the cross-platform approach powerful: your phone and computer habits reinforce each other. If you only address mobile scrolling, you'll migrate to desktop. If you only block websites, you'll switch to apps. One sec creates consistency across your digital life, maintaining that moment of friction regardless of which device you're using.

All usage data stays local on each device. The company doesn't collect your browsing history or app usage patterns. When you sign in with the same account across devices, it syncs your configuration settings (which apps and sites to target, which interventions to use), but not your actual usage data. Privacy is baked into the design.

## Setting Up One Sec: Getting Started in Minutes

Installation is straightforward, though iOS requires a bit more setup than Android due to how Apple's operating system handles app automation. Let's walk through the basics for each platform.

**On iPhone:**

Download one sec from the App Store and open it. The app will guide you through creating a Shortcuts automation. This sounds technical, but one sec provides step-by-step instructions with screenshots. Essentially, you're telling iOS: "When I open Instagram, first run this one sec shortcut."

Choose your first target app—probably whichever steals most of your time. Select an intervention type and duration. The default breathing exercise at five seconds is a good starting point. You can always adjust later.

Test it by trying to open your configured app. The intervention should appear immediately. If it doesn't, the app includes troubleshooting guides to fix common setup issues.

**On Android:**

Download from Google Play and grant the accessibility permissions one sec requests. The app needs these permissions to detect when you open configured apps and display interventions over them.

Select your target apps, choose intervention types, and you're done. Android setup is generally faster than iOS because it doesn't require creating automation workflows.

**Browser Extension:**

Visit the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Safari Extensions gallery and install one sec. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open settings.

Add websites you want to target. You can specify entire domains (twitter.com) or specific pages. Choose whether you want gentle interventions that allow you to proceed after a delay, or complete blocks that prevent access entirely.

The extension includes an adult content filter that can automatically detect and intervene on adult websites without you having to add them manually to your blocklist. This feature runs entirely locally—nothing is sent to one sec's servers.

**Customizing Your Experience:**

After initial setup, explore the intervention types. Try the mirror mode—seeing your own face when you attempt to doomscroll is surprisingly effective at breaking the trance. Experiment with different delay durations. Some users find three seconds enough to break the impulse, while others need ten seconds to truly pause and reflect.

Set up schedules if you want different rules for different times. Maybe you allow social media during lunch breaks but block it completely during morning work hours. One sec makes this kind of contextual control easy.

For users serious about digital wellness, combining multiple strategies works best. Use interventions for apps you need but tend to overuse (like email or messaging), complete blocks for pure time-wasters during work hours, and intentional scheduled access for recreational apps during designated downtime.

## Why One Sec Works When Other Solutions Fail

Digital wellbeing is a crowded market. There are dozens of apps promising to fix your screen time problems, from gamified forest-growing apps to harsh blockers that lock you out entirely. Most people download these tools with genuine motivation, use them for a few days, then quietly uninstall them. Why does one sec succeed where so many others fail?

The answer lies in understanding how habits actually work versus how we think they work. We imagine willpower as a muscle we can strengthen, and if we just build high enough walls around our temptations, we'll stay clean. But neuroscience tells a different story.

Habits are stored in the basal ganglia, a primitive part of the brain that operates largely outside conscious awareness. When you've checked Instagram 50,000 times over the years, the action becomes automatic. Your hand unlocks your phone and taps the colorful square before your prefrontal cortex even knows what's happening. Blocking the app entirely triggers psychological reactance—that feeling of restriction that makes you want to break the rule even more.

One sec's genius is in working with your brain's natural processes rather than against them. The intervention doesn't say "no"—it says "wait." This small shift is psychologically profound. You maintain agency and choice, which reduces reactance. But you also introduce a pattern interrupt at the exact moment your conscious mind needs to override the automatic behavior.

The breathing exercise serves multiple functions. Obviously, it creates a time delay. But it also activates your parasympathetic nervous system, slightly reducing the urgency and anxiety that often drive compulsive phone checking. The visual focus on the breathing animation gives your mind something to do besides thinking about what you're missing on Instagram. And the act of completing the breath—inhaling fully, exhaling completely—creates a micro-achievement that provides a small dopamine hit, partially satisfying the reward-seeking behavior that initiated the phone grab in the first place.

Over time, these interventions don't just stop you from opening apps—they actually recondition the habit loop itself. Your brain learns that opening Instagram no longer delivers instant gratification. There's now effort, delay, and reflection associated with the action. Slowly, the automatic impulse weakens. You attempt to open the app less frequently, not because you're white-knuckling through cravings, but because your brain has learned it's not worth the effort.

This is why the Max Planck study found not just immediate behavior change (36% of attempted openings abandoned after intervention) but also longitudinal change (37% fewer opening attempts by week six). The intervention strategy creates sustainable habit modification, not temporary forced compliance.

Another factor: one sec respects your intelligence and autonomy. You can always choose to proceed past the intervention. This isn't about controlling you—it's about giving you the information and pause you need to make conscious decisions. Paradoxically, this freedom makes the system more effective. When you choose to close the app after an intervention, it feels like your decision, not a restriction imposed on you. This sense of agency strengthens your commitment to change.

Contrast this with apps that lock you out, shame you with guilt-inducing statistics, or rely on gamification that feels childish. Those approaches might work for some people, but they fail for most because they treat you like you're powerless against your own impulses. One sec treats you like an adult who needs better information and timing, not stricter rules.

## Getting the Most Out of One Sec Pro

Simply installing the app isn't enough—like any tool, one sec works best when you understand how to use it strategically. Here are approaches that users report getting the best results with.

**Start With Your Worst Offender:** Don't try to configure 15 apps on day one. Pick the single biggest time-waster in your life—the app that steals hours without you noticing. For most people, that's Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube. Configure just that one app with an intervention and use it for a week. Notice how your relationship with that app changes before adding others.

**Experiment With Intervention Types:** The default breathing exercise works well for many users, but one sec offers multiple intervention styles for a reason. If the breathing feels too easy to bypass, try the text input method that requires typing a random phrase. If you're motivated by accountability, the mirror intervention can be surprisingly powerful. Rotate through different types to see what creates the most friction for you specifically.

**Combine Interventions and Blocks:** For apps you need but overuse (like email or Slack), use the intervention approach. For pure time-wasters that provide no real value, use complete blocking during productive hours. The combination of "delay with awareness" for necessary apps and "total prevention" for junk apps creates a comprehensive system.

**Adjust Timing Based on Context:** Five seconds might be enough friction during the day when you're generally focused, but if you find yourself scrolling at night when discipline is low, increase the delay to ten seconds for evening hours. One sec allows time-based customization, so use it.

**Track Your Progress:** The app shows how many times you attempted to open configured apps and how often interventions succeeded. Review this data weekly. Celebrate reductions in attempt frequency—that means the habit loop is weakening. If interventions are failing frequently, that's feedback to increase friction or rethink which apps really deserve access during certain hours.

**Extend to Your Computer:** Once you've got phone habits under control, add the browser extension. The pattern of unconsciously opening Reddit or Twitter during work moments is often just as destructive as phone scrolling. Cross-platform consistency multiplies effectiveness.

**Use Focus Modes Integration:** If you're on iPhone, integrate one sec with Focus Modes. Your Work focus might block social media entirely, your Personal focus might allow it with interventions, and your Sleep focus might block everything distracting. Let iOS automatically switch contexts based on time or location, and one sec adapts accordingly.

**Share the Journey:** The family plan allows sharing one sec pro with household members. There's something powerful about collective behavior change. When your partner or kids are also using intervention strategies, it normalizes the pauses and creates a culture of intentionality around device use.

**Revisit Your Configuration Monthly:** As habits change, so should your interventions. Maybe Instagram is no longer a problem, but you've developed a new Twitter habit that needs addressing. Or perhaps you've mastered avoiding social media, but email has become the new distraction. Treat your one sec configuration as a living document that evolves with your digital behavior.

If you're ready to start this journey and want access to all these advanced features—unlimited app blocking, customizable interventions, cross-platform synchronization, and detailed analytics—the current offer gives you a complete month to test everything. 👉 [Activate your free month of one sec pro](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) and build a configuration perfectly tailored to your specific distraction patterns.

## Privacy and Data: What One Sec Knows About You

In an era when tech companies treat user data as a resource to be mined and monetized, one sec's approach to privacy stands out. The company makes money by selling subscriptions, not by analyzing and selling your behavior data. This fundamentally different business model means their incentives align with yours.

All usage tracking happens locally on your device. When one sec records that you attempted to open Instagram 47 times today, that data never leaves your phone. The app doesn't send usage statistics to company servers. There's no centralized database of who's scrolling what and when. Your digital behavior is your business.

The browser extension operates on the same principle. The list of websites you visit stays on your computer. The extension checks each URL locally against your configured blocklist but never transmits browsing history anywhere. Even the adult content filter runs entirely client-side using on-device pattern matching.

When you sign in with an account to use one sec across multiple devices, the service syncs your configuration settings—which apps and sites you've chosen to target, which intervention types you prefer, your customized schedules. But it doesn't sync your actual usage data. Your iPhone doesn't know how much you used Twitter on your Mac, and vice versa. Each device maintains its own local records.

The company is based in the United Kingdom and operates as an unfunded, independent company. There are no venture capital investors pressuring them to hit growth targets that would require data harvesting. The founder, Frederik Riedel, has been transparent about the business model: charge a fair price for software that helps people, respect their privacy, and keep improving the product based on user feedback.

One sec doesn't show ads. There's no tracking pixels, no analytics partners, no data brokers involved. When you pay for pro, you're paying for the software functionality, period. The free tier exists because the company genuinely wants people to test whether the intervention approach works for them before committing money, not as a loss leader to gather data for sale.

For those concerned about permissions—particularly on Android where one sec requires accessibility services—the app is open about why each permission is needed. Accessibility permissions allow the app to detect when you open configured apps and display the intervention overlay. Without these permissions, the core functionality simply couldn't work. The app doesn't use these permissions to log keystrokes, capture screenshots, or monitor your activity beyond what's necessary for interventions.

You can verify all of this independently. The browser extension source code is available for review. Security researchers and privacy advocates have examined one sec and consistently rate it highly for data protection practices. For anyone skeptical about yet another screen time app asking for sensitive permissions, one sec has earned trust through transparency and action, not just promises.

## Final Thoughts: Is One Sec Worth Your Time and Money?

Cutting through the noise: if you're someone who routinely loses hours to mindless scrolling despite genuinely wanting to stop, one sec offers the most scientifically validated and psychologically sound approach currently available.

The free version is legitimately useful, not a hollow teaser. Configuring one app with interventions costs nothing and delivers real results if that app is your primary time-waster. Most people should start here to validate whether the friction-based approach works for their brain before committing to a subscription.

One sec pro becomes essential when you realize distraction isn't just about Instagram—it's about the five apps and dozen websites that collectively fragment your attention throughout the day. At $19.99 per year (about $1.67 per month), the annual subscription represents genuine value given that you're buying back dozens of hours of time. If you value your time at even $10 per hour, reclaiming two hours per week means the app pays for itself in about one week.

The science backing the approach isn't marketing fluff. Peer-reviewed research from the Max Planck Institute and Heidelberg University confirms a 57% average reduction in target app usage. Government health programs in multiple countries have validated it. Over 100,000 users have rated it five stars because it actually delivers results. This isn't hype—it's documented effectiveness.

That said, one sec isn't magic. It works when you're genuinely committed to changing your relationship with technology. If you're just looking for a way to scroll without feeling guilty, this isn't the tool for you. But if you're tired of phone addiction stealing your time, energy, and presence—if you're ready to actually change rather than just wish things were different—the intervention approach offers a path forward that respects your intelligence while working with how your brain actually functions.

The current promotional offer removes financial risk from the equation. You get one full month of pro access with all features unlocked. Configure unlimited apps, test every intervention type, use it across all your devices, and see actual results. If it works as well for you as it did for the thousands in the research studies, you'll wonder how you lived without it. If it doesn't fit your needs, you've lost nothing.

Your attention is the most valuable resource you own. Every hour lost to mindless scrolling is an hour you'll never get back—time that could have gone to relationships, creative projects, career advancement, rest, learning, or simply being present in your life. If one sec helps you reclaim even 30 minutes per day, that's 182.5 hours per year. What would you do with an extra 182 hours?

👉 [Start your free month of one sec pro now](https://web.one-sec.app/store?deal=li40) and discover how a simple moment of friction can transform your relationship with technology. The intervention starts working immediately—you might be surprised how much of your scrolling was purely automatic behavior that evaporates the moment you're asked to pause and think.

The real question isn't whether one sec is worth trying. The question is: how much longer are you willing to let unconscious habits steal your most finite resource?
